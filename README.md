WarCraft MDL Importer
=====================

What is this?
-------------

This is a Blender 2.6 addon which allows to import from WarCraft MDL model
files (.mdl). Because the project is still in its early stages, many features
are not done yet. Currently only the import of the very basic geometry works,
but I aim to improve the script whenever I can. Future projects might be an
exporter and support for the MDX model format (.mdx).
