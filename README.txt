What does currently work:
=========================
* Checking the version number, canceling if not 800
* Loading the vertices, normals, texture coords and faces of each geoset


What doesn't work yet:
======================
* Actually _using_ the imported data. Currently, all this script does is to load
  data and then print it to the terminal.


Instructions:
=============

1. Open Blender, preferably from a terminal (otherwise you won't be able to see
   the outcome of the script).

2. In Blender, change the Screen-layout to 'Scripting'.

3. In the Text editor window, open Text->Open Text Block. Then choose the file
   called 'WarMDLImport.py'.

4. In the Text editor window, hit the 'Run Script' button.
